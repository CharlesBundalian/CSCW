                    Being honest here, Edda Café is one of the greatest Visual Novels I have ever played. It was made in a month with heartfelt passion for the 
                    Love Game Jam, it's story is fairly short but it's more than enough to get me crying for a good while. 
                    The quality from the amazing art and music you've seen here are just splendid, I recommend it to anyone and everyone in need of some magic to give it 
                    a try.

                    EDDA café is a short visual novel by mushroomallow for the Valentine's Game Jam, 
                    I do not own any of the music, backgrounds, logo, or intellectual property however it has been liscensed for free use. 
                    Other than that, all food drawings and webdesign are of my own work and have been referenced off of the original game, and I mean heavily 
                    referenced, Edda Cafe was my main inspiration and driving force to putting so much amazing effort into this website! If it weren't for them I 
                    would've probably had better sleep and a bland, basic, dime a dozen design and content that would never stand out at all! 
                    Huge thanks and credits to the amazing team that made Edda Café!
