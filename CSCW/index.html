                <h2>Welcome to Edda Café!</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever heard the legend about the cafe that can turn back time? 
                    A magic chair that can send you to another world? Magical sweets that can change your fate? 
                    If there's a moment in your past that you want to go back to, maybe you should give it a try.

                    But... Who really believes that stuff? I don't like mystical and uncertain things like that. There's no scientific data to 
                    prove any of it. It's all just trickery commercial schemes by the industry to attract customers and empty their wallets.
                    It's just marketing for money, pure and simple.

                    <em>And yet... Why is my heart tickled?
                    </em>

                <p>To any normal person Edda is just any normal café with delicious drinks and pastries that have awfully weird names, but to those who
                    need it the most, Edda café is a place of magic. A place to mend broken hearts, although our food can take you back in time it also starts the flow of time 
                    towards the future to those who have given up and put a pause in their life.
